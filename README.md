## Abstract

Ecotone communities are areas of high species turnover, usually across
steep environmental gradients. We investigated how these steep
environmental gradients shape species interactions between upland and
wetland plant species in an experimental test of the environmental
stress gradient hypothesis, which predicts more positive interspecific
interactions in response to greater environmental stress. Across the
marsh-forest ecotone of the Chesapeake Bay, there are stark shifts in
two fundamental stressors for understory plants: salinity and light
availability. We measured these abiotic stressors and plant productivity
at sites spanning the ecotone and within a forest clear-cut where canopy
shading had been experimentally removed. Field measurements were used to
set treatment levels in a greenhouse manipulation of plant species
neighbor, salinity, and light availability. We hypothesized that marsh
species would be more salt tolerant whereas the upland species would be
more shade tolerant, and, in following the environmental stress gradient
hypothesis, that interactions would become more facilitative in
stressful conditions. Species exhibited a range of salt tolerance, with
the low marsh dominant, *Spartina alterniflora*, exhibiting a true
halophytic response to the salinity levels of the experiment. However,
plant neighbors suppressed biomass production in all light conditions,
and interactions in all treatments remained negative or neutral. These
findings indicate that, despite low resource availability of light and
elevated levels of salinity at opposing edges of the marsh-forest
ecotone, plant interactions resemble a benign stress environment, with
competition predominant and with resource limitation, stress, and
competition having additive, negative effects on plant performance.
These findings support further testing of management activities that
promote marsh migration by increasing light availability, such as
through forest clearing.
